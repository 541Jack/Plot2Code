# Plot2Code Benchmark

Plot2Code benchmark is now open-sourced at [huggingface (ARC Lab)](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC) and [GitHub](https://github.com/TencentARC/Plot2Code). More information can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07990). 


This repository contains the code for an evaluation pipeline that generates Python code from reference plots, executes the generated code to draw plots, and then calculates various evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the generated code.

## Why we need [Plot2Code](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TencentARC/Plot2Code)?
* 🧐 While MLLMs have demonstrated potential in visual contexts, their capabilities in visual coding tasks have not been thoroughly evaluated. Plot2Code offers a platform for comprehensive assessment of these models.

* 🤗 To enable individuals to ascertain the proficiency of AI assistants in generating code that renders into plots given reference plots, we initiated the Plot2Code project. This ensures evaluations are pertinent to real-world applications.

* 💻 Plot2Code accommodates all modalities (text and images) for both input and output, facilitating an exploration of the influence of each modality.

## Supported Tasks

Plot2Code is primarily designed as a benchmark for code generation from scientific plots. Specifically, it supports the following settings:

* Text2Image: We provide instructions to the assistant, requesting it to generate pyplot code and subsequently render the plots.
* Image2Image: Referred to as the Direct Asking setting in our paper, we input the reference plot directly and ask the assistant to generate pyplot code to render similar plots.
* I+T 2 Image: Combining both instructions and reference plots as input, this is called the Conditional Asking setting in our paper.

By employing these settings, we can investigate the impact of each input modality on the quality of the final rendered plots.

## Requirements

- NumPy
- Matplotlib==3.8.4
- Pillow
- Levenshtein
- openai>1.12.0

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Download
You can use following codes to download the dataset：
```shell
git lfs install
mkdir data
cd data
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/TencentARC/Plot2Code
```

## Usage

1. Generate code from reference plots. Add --instruction for the conditional setting.
``` bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=[API_KEY]
export OPENAI_API_BASE=[API_BASE]

# GPT-4V generate code (direct asking)
python -m plot2code.gpt4v_generate_code --prompt_strategy default

# GPT-4V generate code (conditional asking)
python -m plot2code.gpt4v_generate_code --prompt_strategy default --instruct

# GPT-4V generate code (conditional asking with CoT)
python -m plot2code.gpt4v_generate_code --prompt_strategy CoT --instruct
```
2. Execute the generated code to render the plots.
``` bash
python -m plot2code.execute_generated_code --model_name "$model_name" --prompt_strategy $prompt_strategy

```
3. Evaluate the similarity between the generated plots and the grond truth plots.

``` bash
echo "Calculating text match score..."
python -m plot2code.eval.text_match_score  --model_name "$model_name"  --prompt_strategy $prompt_strategy

echo "Calculating gpt-4v evaluation score..."
python -m plot2code.eval.gpt4v_evaluations_score  --model_name "$model_name"  --prompt_strategy $prompt_strategy

echo "Combining evaluation results..."
python -m plot2code.eval.combine_evaluation_results  --model_name "$model_name"  --prompt_strategy $prompt_strategy
```
